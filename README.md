# eedit
Javascript library for making code editors.<br><br>

Installation:<br>
The easiest way is to include a script tag as seen below.
```html
<script src="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/qaiik/eedit/dist/eedit.min.js"></script>
```
That will include the Prism.js and Prism.css dependencies automatically (note - it's already bundled, so if used offline, it will not make requests.)
